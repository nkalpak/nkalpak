# Hi! :wave:

Lately I've been interested in [local-first](https://localfirstweb.dev/) collaborative apps.

## Building

- [ZodForm](https://github.com/nkalpak/zodform) - declarative forms with a Zod schema
- [ImpactDiary](https://www.impactdiary.com/) - a local-first journaling/scheduling app with multi device sync
