# Hi! :wave:

I'm a software engineer who loves building stuff..

Lately I've been interested in [local-first](https://localfirstweb.dev/) collaborative apps.

## Building

- [ZodForm](https://github.com/nkalpak/zodform) - declarative forms from a Zod schema!
- ImpactDiary - a local-first journaling/scheduling app with multi device sync. Not yet public!
